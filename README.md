#Sri Kadimisetty's dot files
These are a collection of my rc files. Feel free to use as you please.


### Installation ###
Clone this repository to a local directory and make symlinks in your home directory to the relevant rc files.

### Future ###
To make the symlinking easier, I will write and include bash scripts that will install and uninstall these files. Untill just do them the good ol' way.


### Notes ### 
Please note the Credits listed at the bottom of each file.
