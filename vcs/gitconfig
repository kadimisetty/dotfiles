# GIT GLOBAL CONFIGURATION FILE
# [`git-config`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-config)
#
# NOTE:
# - Use tabs to be consistent with entries added by `git` cli.
# - See `git-config` docs for a comprehensive formatting reference.
# - `git-config` prefers `;` for comment string, I prefer `#` instead.
#
# BINARIES USED: 
# - `nvim` for editor
# - `bat` for pager
# - `delta` for pager
# - `delta` for cli diff tool
# - `meld` for gui merge tool?
# - `git-media` to handle large media files
# - `git-lfs` to handle large file storage with pointers
